    <h1>Gradients</h1>
    <p>Canvas can also fill shapes with gradients instead of colors. Here's a linear gradient
    An important thing to notice here is that gradient is painted in the coordinate system that the shape is drawn in, not the internal coordinates of the shape. In this example the shape is drawn at 0,0. If we changed the shape to be at 100,100 the gradient would still be in the origin of the screen, so less of the gradient would be drawn, like this:
    </p>
<canvas width="800" height="600" id="canvas"></canvas> 
<script> 
var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas'); 
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d'); 
var grad = ctx.createLinearGradient(0,0,300,00);
grad.addColorStop(0, "green");
grad.addColorStop(0.5, "red");
grad.addColorStop(1, "yellow");

ctx.fillStyle = grad;
ctx.fillRect(0,0,400,200);
