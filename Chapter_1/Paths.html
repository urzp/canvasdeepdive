<h1>Paths</h1>
<p>Canvas only directly supports the rectangle shape. To draw any other shape you must draw it yourself using a path. Paths are shapes created by a bunch of straight or curved line segments. In Canvas you must first define a path with beginPath(), then you can fill it, stroke it, or use it as a clip. You define each line segment with functions like moveTo(), lineTo(), and bezierCurveTo(). This example draws a shape with a move to, followed by a bezier curve segment, then some lines. After creating the path it fills and strokes it.</p>

    c.lineTo(200,90);
    c.lineTo(10,90);
    c.closePath();
    c.fill();
    c.lineWidth = 4;
